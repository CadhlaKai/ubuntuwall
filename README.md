# Ubuntu Wall
A tribute to Ubuntu desktop wallpapers over the years.

I was originally going to make a tribut website for Ubuntu wallpapers over the years just to practice HTML and CSS. However, as I was looking at all of the wallpapers, and recognizing certain ones that I used over the years, and being reminded of that year in my life and what was going on, gave me the idea of creating a website where people can share their memories of their lives at the time that they used a certain wallpaper. This is a tribute to the photographers or graphic designers who created a visual bookmark for us to use, and to Canonical, the Ubuntu dekstop, and the Ubuntu community that helps all of this interconnectivity to exist over the broader world.
